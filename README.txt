SmartClient.py:
- The purpose of this assignment is for SmartClient.py to find out the following information:
    • 1. whether or not the web server supports http2,
    • 2. The cookie name, the expire time (if any), and the domain name (in any) of cookies that
        the web server will use,
    • 3. whether or not the requested web page is password-protected

To execute SmartClient.py, run this in your command line:
    python3 SmartClient.py <uri starting with 'www.' or 'http://'>


**NOTE**
- Unfortunately does not work without 'https://' or 'www.' in front of the command line input for web page; not sure why.
- Redirects and password protection methods were implemented but unfortunately don't work completely :(
